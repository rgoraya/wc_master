  %p You are being asked to participate in a research study to test a game for measuring causal understanding. This research involves playing an online computer game in which you will create a causal map, allowing your virtual creatures to grow and thrive. You will also be given a brief survey asking about your experiences playing the game. The entire activity should last around 90 minutes. There are no direct benefits from participation in this study, though it is intended to be an enjoyable experience. This study can help develop new methods for assessing human understanding of complex systems, which can better enable us to develop effective actions and policies for supporting environmental sustainability.

  %p You are eligible to participate in this study if you are fluent in English. There are no risks associated with this study beyond normal computer and social interaction; participation is entirely voluntary, and you may quit at any time with no penalty.
