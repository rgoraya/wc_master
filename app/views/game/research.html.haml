    %p You are being asked to participate in a research study to test a game for measuring causal understanding. This research involves playing an online computer game in which you will create a causal map, allowing your virtual creatures to grow and thrive. You will also be given a brief survey asking about your experiences playing the game. The entire activity should last around 60 minutes. There are no direct benefits from participation in this study, though it is intended to be an enjoyable experience. This study can help develop new methods for assessing human understanding of complex systems, which can better enable us to develop effective actions and policies for supporting environmental sustainability.
    %p You are eligible to participate in this study if you are fluent in English. There are no risks associated with this study beyond normal computer and social interaction; participation is entirely voluntary, and you may quit at any time.
    %p If you are completing this task as an MTurk HIT, you will receive $5.00 paid to your Mechanical Turk account for your participation in this study. This amount will be paid once we have verified that you played enough to achieve a score of 100 points (payment will be made within 48 hours).
    %p You should not accept this HIT unless all your questions have been answered by a member of the research team listed at the top of this form. By accepting this hit, you indicate that you have read the information in this consent form and have had a chance to ask any question you have about this study. Participation in this study is voluntary. You are free to withdraw from this study at any time.

    %p You are being asked to participate in a research study to test a game for measuring causal understanding. You are eligible to participate in this study if you are fluent in English. This research involves playing an online computer game in which you will create a causal map, allowing your virtual creatures to grow and thrive. You will be given a short survey before the game asking for some simple demographic information, and another survey after the game asking about your experiences using the system. You will also be asked to share your experiences verbally with the researcher, which will be audio-taped. The entire procedure should last around 90 minutes. There are no direct benefits from participation in this study, though it is intended to be an enjoyable experience. This study can help develop new methods for assessing human understanding of complex systems, which can better enable us to develop effective actions and policies for supporting environmental sustainability.
    %p There are no risks associated with this study beyond normal computer and social interaction; participation is entirely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time.
    %p You will receive extra course credit for an eligible course through the UCI Social Sciences human subjects’ pool. You will receive a 1⁄2 unit of course credit for each 1⁄2 hour of participation in this study. Total amount of credit you may earn for this study is 1.5 units. The course instructor offering extra course credit for participation in research must provide alternatives to earn extra course credit. The alternative assignment must require equal or less time and effort for the amount of extra credit that can be earned through participation in research.
    %p All research data collected will be stored securely and confidentially on our servers, though no identifying information will be collected. Audio tapes will be transcribed and destroyed within six weeks.
    %p Participation in this study is voluntary. There is no cost to you for participating. You may choose to skip a question or a study procedure. You may refuse to participate or discontinue your involvement at any time without penalty. You are free to withdraw from this study at any time. If you decide to withdraw from this study you should notify the research team immediately.
